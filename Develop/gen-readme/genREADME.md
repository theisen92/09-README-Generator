# README.md Generator 
  
  ## Discription

  This application is perfect for a developer on the go, who needs to quickly make a professional README.md for a new project, including a section for the description, installation, usage, what license you used, contributing members/files and tests for the project. It also includes a section for questions for anyone who wants to know more about your project.

  ### Installation

  Open terminal or command and navigate to the file and go into the “Develop” folder and run “npm install”

  ### Usage

  To start the app, while still in the “Develop” run “node index.js” then answer the questions to fill in your README.md file. Once you are done, your generated README.md file will be in “gen-readme” folder. If there is already a README.md in the “gen-readme” it will update that file.
